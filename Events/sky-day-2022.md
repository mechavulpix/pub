  * After the concert, if we're not all tired from being old, maybe we'll migrate on to somewhere for drinks? Text me for updates if you're trying to join up for this. It may or may not happen, but I'm just staying open to the possibility.

### Gifts?

Maybe, like, don't? Sweetie, we're gonna be on the go, and like, I cannot keep track. All I really want is my friends to come hang out and listen to awesome music with me. Don't be a brat at my party; that's my job.

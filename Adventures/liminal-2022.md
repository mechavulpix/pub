## Project In-Between 2022

Towards the end of August 2022, spurred by a mountain of name change paperwork
and various civic resposibilites, I inadvertantly began a journey to visit a
number of liminal spaces. A coworker pointed out the irony, and I doubled down
on the joke, claiming I was trying to "visit as many liminal spaces as possible
before Halloween". Spurred by my desire to commit-to-the-bit, and the
encouragement of a Cute Bird, I applied an extra scoop of intentionality, and
thus began documenting my journey throught these spaces...
